# WebDevelopmentSubmission
In my web development course we were asked to develop a website for a band that included a bunch of features as requirements for our modules of second year. This is a copy of that submission.

The functionality of the website includes:
1. Functional login system.
2. Admin features.
3. Add, remove and edit features for parts of the website.
4. use of JQuery.
5. Salted and Hashed passwords (Not under md5).
6. Validation of user input 
7. Use of cookies to monitor session times for security.

The code isn't perfect and does display minor flaws but these are here for future learning possibilities and for good understanding for people looking to learn any of the functionality displayed earlier.

FYI!- This code has been submitted for academic grading and any students wanting to take some of this code could risk getting caught for plagirism so please dont. refer and implement your code with reference to mine if planning to do so.

Any Questions about the code feel free to Email me: Jameswood78000@hotmail.com
